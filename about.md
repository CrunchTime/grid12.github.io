This is an unofficial site dedicated to Grid12, a new online multiplayer game by [Jetbolt Games](http://jetbolt.posthaven.com/). The game is currently in closed beta; if you're interested in testing, please post [here](http://grid12.proboards.com/index.cgi?board=general&action=display&thread=182).

If you got here because you were redirected from the old Neocities address ([http://grid12.neocities.org](http://grid12.neocities.org)) and you're looking for the Grid12 for Dummies guide, it's now under the wiki.

If you have any suggestions, send me a private message on the Grid12 forums!
